# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are your learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
* How would you describe your work style?
* What are your strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
* How will we overcome obstacles?
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?

### Template for DTR Memo

Project: book_club

Group Member Names: Dan Hutchinson, Cesar Jolibois

Project Expectations: In this project we are to learn/practice DB many-to-many relationships, using Rails, database manipulation, MVC structure, basic styling, testing.

Goals and expectations: We would like to complete all functionality and practice light styling. We will be shooting for as close to 100% test-coverage as possible. We also expect to get comfortable with waffle.io as a project management tool.

Team strengths: Dan - I feel fairly comfortable with the basic workflow of MVC architecture, and test-coverage strategies. I am admittedly new to styling, so hoping to strengthen those abilities. Cesar - I feel fairly comfortable with MVC structure and database management. I have some experience with HTML and CSS, as well, but want to practice/improve with grid, bootstrap.

How to overcome obstacles: We both have a fairly comfortable relationship, outside of projects. We are hoping to leverage the techniques we have been taught, such as Pom, etc. to prevent or head-off frustration when encountering difficulties. We also expect that open and honest communication about our own difficulties will keep us from becoming frustrated with eachother. In case this does occur, we will do our best to keep the other informed of feelings so that we can get space or help as and when needed.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?): We are both fairly flexible in timing. We both prefer to use paired programming, especially driver/navigator, at least at first. We may then come to rely more on divide/conquer using waffle.io to distribute individual tasks.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
We will be in near-constant communication. We don't foresee any major difficulties in this regard. We will communicate using any and all available means.

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
Dan is definitely more novice at front-end styling and hopes to learn more as we go along. Rails is new to Dan entirely so he is hoping to adapt quickly to the version of MVC architecture utilized in rails, but feels confident in doing so. Cesar has some more familiarity with both front-end and rails, but needs to get more familiar with certain gems, including RSpec.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
We will be shooting for 50/50 workload split. There is no real reason why this shouldn't be do-able. If, along the way, we find disparities in areas of strength, we may distribute workload for maximum efficiency, though we both want to gain familiarity in areas where we currently may lack.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
We will be using GitHub and waffle.io to manage workflow. Waffle is new to both of us but seems to integrate readily with github and we don't foresee any major issues. We will, of course, always review any pull requests submitted by the other partner, in order to regulate and track changes as they are merged. In case of merge conflicts, we will discuss together before accepting any changes.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
We are both fairly comfortable with one another and plan to maintain open and honest communication, including feedback, in an ongoing and constant way.

Agenda to discuss project launch:
As we complete this DTR we will also be discussing project launch, and should be ready to begin work by the end of day 1.

Ideas: 

Tools: waffle.io, Rails, RSpec.
